> Depression is for rich people, you better get your shit together and go back to work.
A random guy says to a girl on the back table while I was eating Chilaquiles Verdes in [Fonda Dona Blanca](https://goo.gl/maps/weosQEPuDM6EKcG48) in Mexico City.

Selecting, renaming, sorting, playing, testing, uploading.

I've been writing(?) music for over the past year under what I consider a strange influence, but definitely driven by the fact I've spent a few thousands of US dollars on musical equipment to keep me entertained on my spare time; enters a slightly amount of buyers remorse in a Venn diagram along with minimalism conflicts.

Upload of the day is:

[Xicotepec!](https://morgenmx.bandcamp.com/album/xicotec-ep)

For Fans Of: Eating alone in the dark.

Schlecht at genres, especially when it's something I've done, but expect subtle dark atmospheres and clipping.
