> "You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next."

From last Bong Joon-ho's movie: Parasite.

A friend making fun of me and how I plan every day of my life like a typical German. Ironically, for lack of planning in my youth, right after I finished my University degree, I'm still stranded here in **Puebla, Mex** while I wait for the German Embassy to get my working visa process finished so I can start working on the company that hired me since March last year...

Based on my high expectations and how I am my best -and worst- critic, do I feel like a parasite for not being able to work and live in **Frankfurt** yet? 
No.

Other than patience, I have learned quite a lot since last year, both personal and professionally speaking. I had to find another job in the meantime, and I was hired by one of the most important companies in the IT world, coincidentally, also German.

I have learned to embrace processes, it's all about the processes:

- Are you good at *IT'ing*? Irrelevant.
- Can you follow this procedure? It's all that matters.
- Will you be able to improve this process? You will stand out from the rest.\
