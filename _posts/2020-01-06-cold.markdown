A year of cold showers. Not 365 but about 350.

Why?

No reason. A Reason. Many reasons. Hipster? Alternativo? Depression? Minimalism? KISS philosophy? Cheap ass? Health benefits? Nice skin? Good hair? Energetic? Confidence? Something to talk about to you?

And if you are a fellow redditor, you might have imagined there is a sub for this alright: [/r/coldshowers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coldshowers/).

Ironically, the few ones I skipped, it was due to depression; I missed a warm sensation and I couldn't get out of my bed at 6 AM to go out and walk/run with the dog. So hot water it was and it sure helped.


Instagram sucks.
