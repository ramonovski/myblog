Today it was The Lighthouse.

Dissapointing? Vielleicht.

As a huge fan of the only horror movie I've enjoyed in my entire life, expectations were high. I didn't read any reviews of the movie, I was not even aware of the plot. The only 2 things I knew about, it was that Willem Dafoe and the Pattinson guy were the main characters, but not the only 2!*\
The horror movie is The VVitch, which I once made a song for after watching it:

And my most popular YouTube video as of now with 5,556 views.


And Jurgen Klopp.

Strange(?) way to spend my morning. I will talk about him and his philosophy in another post.
